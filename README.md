# WebDevelopmentWorkflowModel

This is a web development workflow model I've created that includes:
- Babel polyfill
- Css Autoprefixer and minimizer
- Sass Compiler
- Javascript bundler and minimizer (with webpack)

It also included a live-server with auto-reloading web pages.

To get started do in the terminal:
> npm install

To load live server:
> npm start

To get production compilation:
> npm run build
